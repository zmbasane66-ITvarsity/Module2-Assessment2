                    <p>Jet.com was an American e-commerce company headquartered in Hoboken, New Jersey. The company was co-founded in 2014 by Marc Lore (who had previously sold Diapers.com to Amazon.com), along with Mike Hanrahan and Nate Faust. Jet.com raised $820 million over four venture rounds from GV, Goldman Sachs, Bain Capital Ventures, Accel Partners, Alibaba Group, and Fidelity.[4] The website was formally launched in July 2015.[5][6] In Fall 2016, it became a subsidiary of Walmart</p>

                    <p>In June 2019, in the wake of slumping sales through the Jet.com site in the period since the acquisition,[8] the majority of Jet.com employees were transferred to work on the Walmart.com site and Simon Belsham, the president of Jet.com, stepped down.[9] On May 19, 2020, Walmart announced that it was shutting down Jet.com,[10] which they later did without warning on June 4, directing visitors to use Walmart.com instead.</p>
