                    <p>Gus Ackerman opened the first Ackermans store in 1916 in Wynberg, Cape Town. Ackermans was sold to Greatermans in 1960 only to be sold again towards the end of the 1970s to Edgars.

In 1984 Pepkor acquired Ackermans and its 34 stores. Since then Ackermans has experienced exceptional growth and in the year 2000 it had over 200 outlets across the Southern Africa region</p>
