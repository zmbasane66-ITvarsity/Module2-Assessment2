                    <p>The Shoprite Group of companies was established in 1979. In 1990 Shoprite opened in Namibia. In 1998, it acquired the national Checkers chain. In 1995 the first store in Lusaka, Zambia, was opened. That same year they acquired a centralised distribution company Sentra, which had been acting as a central buyer for 550 owner-managed supermarkets, thereby allowing Shoprite to expand into franchising.On 24 December 1996 a bomb exploded in a Worcester Shoprite and killed 3 people and injured over 50. It was a racially motivated act that shocked the company</p>

                    <p>THE Shoprite Group now generates enough electricity to power over 1 100 households – 12 300 MWh of electricity – a year from solar energy, following the installation of rooftop PV (photovoltaic) panels at 19 sites in South Africa and Namibia.

The Group has also fitted 649 solar panels to the roofs of its refrigerated trucks, which generate 760 MWh annually – enough power to run 1 040 refrigerators for a full year. These allow drivers to switch off truck ignitions at delivery locations, reducing noise and exhaust pollution, while keeping the cold chain intact.</p>
