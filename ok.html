                    <p>OK Foods are modern, service-oriented supermarkets situated in neighbourhoods. The layout of each outlet is planned in the most cost-effective way and the store design enforces optimum customer flow and product exposure, enabling franchisees to take advantage of every possible sales and profit opportunity.</p>
