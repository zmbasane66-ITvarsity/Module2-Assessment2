                   <p>Founded by Max Sonnenberg, Woolworths first opened its doors on 30 October 1931 in Plein Street Cape Town, in the dining room of the recently-closed down Royal Hotel. It was an immediate success, and two more stores were opened in the Cape. It was clear that the new business had the potential to expand nationwide except for a lack of capital. Sonnenberg's friend Elie Susman put up the money for the expansion of the business into the Transvaal and became Sonnenberg's business partner.</p>

Woolworths, however, has no association to Australia's Woolworths supermarket chain.</p>
